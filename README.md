# Federated Learning for MIBC Diagnosis

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the paper:
**"[Federated Learning-Based Multi-Task Framework for Privacy-Preserving Diagnosis of Muscle Invasion in Bladder Cancer]"**

## 📋 Introduction
We propose a privacy-preserving Federated Learning framework for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) diagnosis. The model simultaneously performs tumor segmentation and invasion classification using a multi-task learning architecture.
